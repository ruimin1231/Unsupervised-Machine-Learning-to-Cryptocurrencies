# **Unsupervised Machine Learning**

---

## **Overview**

The project aims to create an analysis for the clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. It includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm and visualize the findings with the clients.



## **Results**
###1. Elbow curve to find the best value for K
